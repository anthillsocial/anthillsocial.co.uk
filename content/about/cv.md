#### PROFILE   
Through combinations of making, programming, academic research, and writing I critically examine the formation of technological objects and the social eddies that surround them. Since 1998 I have worked as a researcher with Citizen Sense, a European Research Council project, and as an arts practitioner, internationally exhibited artist, programmer, designer and maker. I work independently and in multidisciplinary teams. Technically, I have created hi­tech sensor driven environments, reactive video and robotic installations, and software platforms for project collaboration. Settings include research environments, participatory projects with adult and youth groups, exhibits in contemporary galleries.
