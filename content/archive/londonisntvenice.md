A brightly clad troupe of masked Venetians are travelling along the river Thames and London canal network looking for a new home after floods have engulfed Venice. Alighting from their boat, accompanied by an accordion and singing Italian love songs: "Ladies and gentlemen, senori and senorina of London, dwellers on the banks of this great waterway: greetings! Greetings from Venezia! Our city. City of water and light, and... carnival! City of mystery, romance andâ€¦ FLOODS!!!"
