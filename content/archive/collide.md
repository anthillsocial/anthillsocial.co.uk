A collaboration with artist Fiona Geilinger, we created an interactive kaleidoscopic video work using six projectors casting images on the walls of InQbate. After a 20 minute choreographed performance, the audience were free to play with the Kaleidoscopic effect.

Part of a series of events held in <a href="/archive/inqbate/">InQbate</a>, the experimental interactive media space positioned in Sussex university that I worked closely with between 2009 and 2010. These events were used as a testing ground for developing a series of interactive digital media installations, most of which have been written using <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">OpenFrameworks</a>. These experiments have informed the development of a new control system with the space to easily enable creative experimentation with the environment.
