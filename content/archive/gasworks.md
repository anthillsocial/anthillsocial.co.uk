A participatory arts project commissioned by Stream Arts. This multi media website (images & streamed audio) encouraged local people to explore the history of East Greenwich and the Greenwich Peninsula within living memory (1920's to present day).  

We created a website and set of tools so users with varying degrees of technical know-how are able to upload images and tag/comment on oral history recordings, which allows discrete segments of very long interviews can be instantly accessed and categorised along with images.

Created over a number of months during 2006, this website was developed in collaboration with local residents where ideas on: design, interface and functionality were all driven by a series of evening workshops.
