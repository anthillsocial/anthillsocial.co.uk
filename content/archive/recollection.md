I worked with Kettles Yard to create this cross-generational oral history archive that reflects how people think and feel about Kettle’s Yard. This website offers a selection of extracts from interviews with people of all ages, some of whom have known Kettle's Yard for decades, some of whom were visiting for the first time.

Kettle's Yard was the private home of Jim and Helen Ede, who lived there from 1957-1973. Kettle's Yard maintains Jim’s vision of the house as a ‘way of life’. His collection of paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures is arranged amongst ceramics, glassware and natural objects, creating a retreat from the busy hustle of our everyday lives. The house and its contents were gifted to the University of Cambridge in 1966 and have since been expanded several times to include a temporary exhibition gallery.
