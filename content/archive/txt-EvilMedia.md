I contributed to, and assisted <a href="http://yoha.co.uk/" title="YoHa">YoHa</a> in the production of the <a href="http://www.transmediale.de/content/evil-media-distribution-centre" title="Evil Media Distribution Centre">Evil Media Distribution Centre</a>, which was displayed at the 2013 <a href="http://www.transmediale.de/" title="Transmediale">Transmediale festival</a> in Berlin. The installation is an artistic response to the recently published book Evil Media (2012) by Matthew Fuller and Andrew Goffey, which focusses on the pervasive presence of so-called “gray media” - an expanded notion of media or forms of mediation that provides a deeper, more complex understanding of their effects on how we act, perceive and think in our daily lives.

Sixty six contributors were invited to choose and write a short text about a gray media object (ranging from tampons to software compilers), and these texts and objects were then presented in the setting of a curiosity cabinet designed as a distribution center. Members of the <a href="http://opensystem.org.uk">Open Systems Association</a> (of which I am a part) contributed several of the texts. My two contributions "Roomba" and "Shift Register - 7400 Series" can be seen below, along with a list of all contributors.

## Roomba
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Tom Keene<br>
<strong>Date of origin:</strong> Introduced in 2002. <br>
<strong>Manufacturer:</strong> iRobot <br>
A 13” diameter, 3.5" high, autonomous vacuum cleaner equipped with sensors that detect obstacles, dirt, recharging points, airflow, malfunction and impassable staircases. A central processing unit controls power to fans, brushes, an audio speaker, motors, and wheels. It employs an algorithmic cleaning pattern that spirals, follows walls and randomly selects direction. If a Roomba gets stuck, humans are instructed to “Lift and move Roomba to a new location” by a firm yet comforting female robot voice. Designed to fight dirt and grime, they are built by iRobot, one of the largest manufacturers of military robotics in the US.</p>

## Shift Register - 7400 Series
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Tom Keene<br>
<strong>Date of origin:</strong> 1940s<br>
<strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Texas Instruments<br>
The Shift register is an early form of computer memory that dates back to the Colossus computer of the 1940s. In the 1960s they were popularized by the Texas Instruments 7400 series of logic chips which introduced the familiar ‘black box’ Integrated Circuit to the electronics industry.    Set by a timed sequence of electrical pulse, Shift Registers are simultaneously a mathematical concept, algorithm and hardware chip entangled within computational systems. A core component of digital logic, they control arrays of actuators, encode and decode signals, act as glue between parallel and serial transmissions, multiplex and delay output, reduce wire count in circuits, and store and distribute data to peripheral devices or individual sections of a Central Processing Unit.
