#### Project activities

**Displacement Calculator**          
An online form that clarified Lambeth's financial offer to homeowners of Cressingham. The formalised programmatic structure of the form revealed the disjuncture between Lambeth's cabinet reports, financial viability assessments, and guarantees to residents facing demolition of their homes.

**Housing Justice**          
A workshop, that I helped devise and deliver, instigated by the housing activist group Concrete Action, Bournemouth University Civic Media Hub, The Centre for Excellence in Media Practice, and Centre for Investigative Journalism.

**Lambeth Tech Timelines**          
Multiple timelines of Lambeth's administrative technologies, legislation, issues of repair, and historical technical artefacts. They reveal how database technologies and practices are coextensive with central and local government decision making.

**Land Value Plot**          
A visualisation of property sales on Cressigham compared against Lambeth's proposed new-build prices and average sale prices in the borough.

**Paper Houses**          
A craft activity making houses out of paper print-outs of 5,000 Schedule of Rates(SOR) codes obtained via Freedom of Information requests. This activity revealed how abstract codes can produce multiple associations both inside and outside the technical confines of a database.

**Regen Cheat Sheet**          
A collaboratively written guide for residents and activists. It covers technical information, expertise, legal processes, and general practicalities for coping with a local authority regeneration project.

**The Regeneration Algorithm**          
An SQL query that calculates the average cost of repair for housing estates across Lambeth.

**Search Drill**          
A physical electric drill controlled by a database table that defines costs of repairs within Lambeth. The drill evolved from a device used within a community event, to an exhibit within an exhibition titled *Toolkits for Community Resistance in Housing*.

**Service Charge Parser**          
A programming script that uses computer vision technologies to extract a table of data from .pdf versions of homeowner service charge bills. This script supported efforts by Cressingham residents to contest Â£127,000 of repairs undertaken by Lambeth contractors and staff.

**Shadow Database**          
A resident-led recreation of Lambeth's housing database systems. The interface to this database overlays video footage with data obtained via Freedom of Information requests; an audit of Lambeth's accounts in accordance with Section 26 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act; and an assessment of Cressingham residents (by central government) for the Right to Manage their estate.

**Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)**          
A bicycle trailer that records audio and video footage of Cressingham, instigates conversations with residents about repairs in their homes, and provides a way of looking after my children while working. The title of this artefact is a humorous play on words as an SPV is a private company structure employed by Local authorities to finance regeneration projects outside of typical legislative constraints.

**Spreadsheet Schema**          
A spreadsheet used to reverse-engineer hidden database structures employed by Lambeth in the management of their housing stock.
