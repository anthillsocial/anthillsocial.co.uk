#### A collaboration between The Anthill Social, Space Studios and Queen Mary University London.

Design and development of a website for "Performing Rights" a festival of creative dialogues between artists, academics, activists, and audiences investigating relationships between human rights and performance composed of two distinct but related programmes: a Conference and a series of Manifestations.

www.performingrightslibrary.org The performing rights library invited online contributions, networks international communities, creates space for dialogue and enables the transmission and documentation of human rights and performance. It looks at the significance of human rights in times of war and globalisation, makes links between international and local communities and investigates performance practices that will facilitate human rights work.
