Sign X Here continues conversations started in past Stream projects. We've been having a chat with local residents, businesses and organisations around East Greenwich who have shared their ideas to help devise a trail of signs reflecting the observations and experiences of urban regeneration in the area. Using quotes and inspiration from; past projects, conversations with previous participants, local residents, local businesses, youth radio station Fresh FM and local police. Activities include local walks with the local Community Police officers, chats over a cup of tea or a pint, group meetings, photographing making and placing signs. A final publication will bring together images of the signs installed with their location expanded by the thoughts and imaginations of participants, gathered during the life of the project.
