Authors: Tom Keene & George Butler. This artists commission from Independent Photography brought together a group of elderly residents and a group of young people aged 12-16. With these two groups we produced a short film over a 10 week period Summer/Autumn 2005. Young people consisted entirely of girls from a local youth club and the elderly group resided in a residential care home.
